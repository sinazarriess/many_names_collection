- "? add file with (VG) urls of image files instead of images?": I'd do both. 

- vg_image_id duplicated in the readme.

- I'd use "topname" and "domain" instead of "mn_..."; MN is the default, so only need to mark it in the vg cases (e.g. "vg_domain").

- %top column, I'd use "perc_top", cause symbols like % can give issues in some software

- "vg_cat ... The WordNet hypernym of the VG synset": which depth? Or criterion? Also, maybe we can put it in only one of the tsv files (now it's in both the images and manynames files)

- "bbox_xywh": I'd put "bbox_coords", for clarity

- "Data folders": replace by "Folders"? (there's a "scripts" folder)
