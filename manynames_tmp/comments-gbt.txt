- "? add file with (VG) urls of image files instead of images?": I'd do both. 
CS: ok

- vg_image_id duplicated in the readme.
CS: I can't find the duplicates

- I'd use "topname" and "domain" instead of "mn_..."; MN is the default, so only need to mark it in the vg cases (e.g. "vg_domain").
CS: I'd do it the way with "mn" for greater clarity, but can change it, of course. 

- "vg_cat ... The WordNet hypernym of the VG synset": which depth? Or criterion? Also, maybe we can put it in only one of the tsv files (now it's in both the images and manynames files)
CS: These were the original categories to be considered, and obtained manually, before you introduced the 7 MN domains which subsume the categories. TODO

- "bbox_xywh": I'd put "bbox_coords", for clarity
CS: coords is not clearer, there are different ways to give the bounding box, e.g., [x,y,width,height], or [x_min,y_min,x_max,Y_max].
