# ManyNames

Repository for the ManyNames dataset



**TODOs**:

- [ ] add file with (VG) urls of image files; add VG images
- [ ] add and describe script for WN relations@LREC paper
- [x] double-check bbox ccordinates
- [ ] add preproc scripts + raw data from computer@UPF
- [x] change incorrect column to singletons, also for MNv2.0
- [ ] column VG_cat only in MNv1.0
- [x] remove prefix from MN columns

## ManyNames dataset Version 1.0
###### ManyNames_v1.0 completed as of 8 January 2020

Below we describe the data that is availabe for download in this repository.

##### Notation
**MN** Abbreviation for ManyNames  
**VG** Abbreviation for VisualGenome  
**domain** The MN categorisation of objects into  
   * people
   * animals_plants
   * vehicles
   * food
   * home
   * buildings
   * clothing

For each domain, there exists at least one WordNet category out of *article of clothing*, *instrumentality, instrumentation*, *person*, *tableware*, *ware*, *food, nutrient*, *structure, construction*, *animal*, *tool*, *food, solid food*, *plant, flora, plant life*, *vehicle*.
   
#### Data file: manynames-v1.0.tsv

| Column | Type | Description | 
| -------- | :-------: | -------- |
| vg_image_id | int | The VG id of the image |
| vg_object_id | int | The VG id of the object |
| url | str | The url to the image, with the object marked |
| topname | str | The most frequent name in the MN responses |
| domain | str | The MN domain of the MN object |
| N | float | The number of types in the MN responses |
| perc_top | float | The relative frequency of the most frequent response (in percent) |
| H | float | The H agreement measure from (Snodgrass and Vanderwart, 1980) |
| responses | Counter | The collected MN names and their counts, i.e., the number of annotators responding them |
| singletons | dict | Contains all names which were given only once, i.e., with count=1. <br>Example: `{'sofa': 1, 'armchair': 1}` |
| vg_obj_name | str | The VG name of the object |
| vg_domain | str | The MN domain of the VG name, which may be a superset of its WN category (vg_cat, see `images.tsv`). <br>Example: The MN domain *food* subsumes the WN categories *food, solid food* and *food, nutrient*. |
| vg_synset | str | The WN synset of the object, provided by VG |

#### Data file: images.tsv
| Column | Type | Description |
| -------- | :-------: | -------- |
| vg_image_id | int | The VG id of the image |
| vg_image_name | str | The name of the VG image |
| vg_object_id | int | The VG id of the object |
| vg_obj_name | str | The VG name of the object |
| bbox_xywh | list | The coordinates of the object in the image: [left x, bottom y, width, height] <br>(y=0 is at the top of the image)|
| vg_synset | str | The WN synset of the object, provided by VG |
| vg_cat | str | The WordNet hypernym of the VG synset, corresponds roughly to one of the 7 MN domains.  |

#### scripts/
###### Package Requirements:
  * `pandas`
  * `numpy`
  * `matplotlib.pyplot` (for `agreement_table.py` and `visualise.py`)
  * `nltk` and `nltk.corpus` (for `wordnet_analysis.py`,   `agreement_table.py`)
  * `skimage` (for `visualise.py`)

###### Usage:
All scripts can be given as optional argument the path to the ManyNames dataset: 
`python <script-name> [$MANYNAMESROOT/manynames_v1.0.tsv]`
By default, `$MANYNAMESROOT` is `../` from the script directory.
* **`manynames.py`**
  *Loads the MN data into a pandas DataFrame.*<br>
  `python manynames.py [$MANYNAMESROOT/manynames_v1.0.tsv]`
* **`visualise.py`**
  *Provides a function to draw a bounding box around an object and label it with its MN object names (and VG name).*
  You can run a demo of it with `python visualise.py`
* **`agreement_table.py`**
  *Creates a table (in tex format) of the agreement in object naming of MN. (Table 3 in the [paper](https://github.com/amore-upf/manynames/lrec2020naming.pdf)).*<br>
  `python agreement_table.py [$MANYNAMESROOT/manynames_v1.0.tsv]`
* **`plot_distr_topnames.py`**
  *Creates a stacked box plot, showing the distribution of top MN names per domain (Figure 3 in the [paper](https://github.com/amore-upf/manynames/lrec2020naming.pdf)).*<br>
  `python plot_distr_topnames.py [$MANYNAMESROOT/manynames_v1.0.tsv]`
* `wordnet_analysis.py`
  TODO
   *   **Data Prerequisites:** Download the object annotations in [objects.json.zip](https://visualgenome.org/static/data/dataset/objects.json.zip "objects.json.zip") from [VisualGenome](https://visualgenome.org "VisualGenome") (VisualGenome version 1.4) and save it under `$MANYNAMESROOT/vgenome/`.
