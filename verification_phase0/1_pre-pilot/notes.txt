To be improved:
- better instructions color task (mustard and cheese; vs. completely unrelated objects; explain question mark)
- remove 'threat'; better explain the procedure
- explain bonus policy
- bounding boxes always have the same (horizontal/vertical) orientation, so for objects that are tilted, a 'tight fitting' bounding box can still have quite a bit of empty space!
