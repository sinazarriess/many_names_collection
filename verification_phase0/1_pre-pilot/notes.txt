To be improved after pre-pilot2:
[DONE] - ASTY1XNJS7RSV: get back to her after results; "I can't figure out which one(s) could possibly be wrong. Any insight?"
[DONE] - better instructions color task, add picture
[DONE] - explain bonus policy
[DONE] - friendlier warnings

unique_worker_id = "Are you sure? Your answers to many of our quality control items are incorrect.\n\nWe advise you click CANCEL to check the instructions and double-check your answers, and contact us if anything remains unclear.\n\nYou can also click OK anyway to submit, and we are reasonable humans, but proceed to do more HITs of this type at your own risk!".encode('utf-8').hex()
unique_HIT_id = "Friendly warning (don't worry): you seem to have answered several quality control items incorrectly.\n\nIf you get these warnings regularly, you may have misunderstood the task, so please check the instructions or contact us.\n\nIf you get these warnings only once in a while, then don't worry, just click OK to submit and we hope to 'see' you in the next HIT!".encode('utf-8').hex()

[DONE] - bounding boxes always have the same (horizontal/vertical) orientation, so for objects that are tilted, a 'tight fitting' bounding box can still have quite a bit of empty space!
[DONE] - Add more examples, mainly of bounding box errors and 'same object' errors.
