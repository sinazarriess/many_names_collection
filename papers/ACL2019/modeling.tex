\section{Model}

\subsection{Model 1}
Train a simple naming model (classifiers) on original VisualGenome names. Test it on our data. How well does the model predict the most familiar name and the set of available names?

\subsection{Model 2}
Train a simple naming model (classifiers) on our data, maybe combined with VisualGenome data. How well does it work?

\subsection{Model 3}

can we model taxonomic/conceptual knowledge more directly? induce a taxonomy? or a multi-modal space for objects + names?
