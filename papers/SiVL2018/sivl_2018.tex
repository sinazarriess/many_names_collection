\section{Introduction}

Real-world objects are members of many categories and speakers can typically choose between different, more or less specific names when referring to a particular visual entity. 
For instance, the entity surrounded by the green box in Figure \ref{fig:example} is an instance of the categories \textit{female child, child, female, person, organism}, etc.\  and can be referred to with names such as, e.g.,\ \textit{girl, kid, cutie, daughter, person, human}.
But even though almost every task in language \& vision involves the prediction of object names (e.g. image captioning, referring expression generation, visual dialogue), hardly any research has explicitly looked at object naming, i.e.\ determining the actual word/linguistic concept that speakers would use to refer to an object (in a particular context), but see \cite{Ordonez:2016,zarriess-schlangen:2017}.
Even research in pragmatics, that traditionally deals with reference and referring expression production, has mostly focused on attributes, rather than object names.
Recently, however, \cite{graf2016animal} have shown that object naming preferences are subject to contextual constraints and pragmatic factors: in a typical reference game set-up with images of target objects surrounded by distractor objects,\cs{of target objects, each  presented along with images of distractor objects} speakers have been found to flexibly adjust object names depending on the context. For instance, a \textit{dalmatian} would be called \textit{dalmatian} in the context of other dogs or simply \textit{dog} when none of the distractors is also a dog.
This extends previous traditional work on concepts suggesting that the typicality of a referent determines its entry-level category (and consequently, its name) \cite{Rosch1978}.


Most research on computer vision and object recognition has somehow worked around the fact that objects can be instances of multiple, hierarchically embedded categories. 
State-of-the-art recognition models are mostly trained as classifiers on a flat of 1000 categories in ImageNet, reducing the ImageNet ontology to an inherently flat annotation scheme and treating
object labels as mutually exclusive.

On the vision side, however, there is a huge body of research on object recognition, i.e.\ labeling visual objects according to a set of categories, cf.\ \cite{simonyan2014very,deng2014large,googlenet}.
