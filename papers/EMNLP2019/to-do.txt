- crossclassified: should I distinguish between "adjacent" and "co-hyponym"?

- Sina: produce agreement (e.g. top %) boxplots per domain; then, within each domain, produce boxplots per synset (just for us to look at them)

- Sina: do you mind if I change table 4 (wordnet) into percentages? (I've seen the code and know where to change it)

TODOs removed from paper (for future work ;)):
data-collection:
\cs{@Carina ToDo: add some examples of synsets + names; maybe in suppl}
\cs{Maybe say something about the rejections, if space permits it.}

Because of the Zipfian distribution of names, and to balance the collection, we sampled instances depending on the size of the seeds: up to $500$\ instances for seeds with up to $800$\ objects, and up to $1000$\ instances for larger seeds. \textbf{double-check}
