- crossclassified: should I distinguish between "adjacent" and "co-hyponym"?

- Sina: produce agreement (e.g. top %) boxplots per domain; then, within each domain, produce boxplots per synset (just for us to look at them)

- Sina: do you mind if I change table 4 (wordnet) into percentages? (I've seen the code and know where to change it)
