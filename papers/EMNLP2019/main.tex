	\begin{abstract}
		While research in language \& vision is well aware that there is variation in scene description, object naming has been addressed in a comparatively simplistic way: 
		Typically, a single label is provided for each object, and assumed to be its canonical category or name.
		Existing work on linguistic variation in natural object naming, i.e.\ reference, has used taxonomy-driven models that retrieve hierarchically related names for the canonical name from WordNet. 
		We study variation in object naming in a less constrained setting and elicit dozens of names from different speakers for the same instance in an image (25K objects in the VisualGenome dataset).
		The resulting dataset, ManyNames, reveals that instances do tend to have a preferred name, though the level of agreement varies widely across domains (e.g. animals and people).
		We also show that most object classes (synsets) annotated in VisualGenome correspond to a large set of actual names ($\sim$30 on average) and that most of these name variants do not have a hierarchical relation to the annotated synset.
		Phenomena like cross-classification of objects (\textit{cat-toy}) and metonymy (\textit{bowl-fruit}) feature prominently, as do disagreements about what object is being referred to.
		We investigate whether a state-of-the-art model of object labeling implicitly encodes similar variation in object naming and discuss implications for research in language \& vision.
