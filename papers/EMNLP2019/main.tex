\begin{abstract}
In research on language \& vision, it is well known that different speakers interpret and describe the same visual scene in many different ways.
Individual visual objects, however, are usually simply annotated with a single canonical name, assuming that linguistic variants of the canonical name that would occur in natural naming situations (e.g. when referring to the object) can be retrieved from a taxonomy like WordNet.
We put these assumptions to an empirical test and elicit (from 36 subjects) a dataset of non-canonicalized object names on top of 25k objects of the VisualGenome dataset. \\
Our results reveal a manageable (/modest/moderate(?)) amount of variation in names given to individual objects (approx. 3 types on average), and wide variation in names for objects of the same category (e.g.\ dog; around 30 types on average). 
%\cs{Is with category ANIMAL meant, or more dog --> many images of dog, high variation?}
%\cs{Should it made explicit that most instances have more than one name?}
%\cs{What does "decent" mean?}
We observe that most of the alternatives for the canonical VisualGenome name cannot be retrieved via hierarchical relations encoded in WordNet. 
Instead, a major portion of the variation is accounted for by more complex relations like cross-classification of objects, metonymy or variation due to visual uncertainty.  
We investigate whether a state-of-the-art model of object labeling implicitly encodes similar variation in object naming and discuss implications for research in language \& vision.
