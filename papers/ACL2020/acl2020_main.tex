%\input{introduction}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Real-world objects, being members of many categories, can be called by many names. Nonetheless, humans have a preferred name which they use to call an object (CITE) (\textsl{entry-level name}). 
	\item ...
	\item ...
	\item ...
	\item We adopt an empirical view on the notion of entry-level name, and define it  as the most frequently given name by humans who were asked to name an object depicted in an image. 
	\item ...
	\item ...
	\item This paper:
	\item We address the problem of (entry-level) object naming, and use the \mn dataset that provides many name annotations per object to obtain entry-level names and their alternatives for each object instance. 
	\item Contributions are XXX:
	\item[(1)] We obtain verified name responses for each object in \mn, along with name sets of originally wrongly identified objects. 
	\item We provide an analysis of naming variation: Agreement, number of alternatives, ...
	\item[(2)] ...

\paragraph{(Entry-Level) Object Names}
Cognitive Science/psycholinguistics:\\
- levels of specificity\\
- basic-level vs. entry-level\\
- object naming studies
Language + Vision:\\
Ordonez et al., Zarriess \& Schlangen, ... \\
- Our work: empirical notion of entry-level

\paragraph{Visual Object Recognition in Computer Vision}
- Object detection, using pre-trained features representations (see next point) (localize object and predict its \textit{label}; trained with, e.g.\ more coarse-grained ImageNet labels or VG names)\\
- Pre-trained feature representations, trained on image classification with 1000 ImageNet fine-grained labels (predict \textit{label} for most salient object in image)\\
- Our work: can object detectors account for natural human object naming with respect to predicting the entry-level name?

\appendix

\section{Appendices}
\label{sec:appendix}
Appendices are material that can be read, and include lemmas, formulas, proofs, and tables that are not critical to the reading and understanding of the paper. 
Appendices should be \textbf{uploaded as supplementary material} when submitting the paper for review.
Upon acceptance, the appendices come after the references, as shown here.

\paragraph{\LaTeX-specific details:}
Use {\small\verb|\appendix|} before any appendix section to switch the section numbering over to letters.


\section{Supplemental Material}
\label{sec:supplemental}
Supplementary material may report preprocessing decisions, model parameters, and other details necessary for the replication of the experiments reported in the paper.
Seemingly small preprocessing decisions can sometimes make a large difference in performance, so it is crucial to record such decisions to precisely characterize state-of-the-art methods.
