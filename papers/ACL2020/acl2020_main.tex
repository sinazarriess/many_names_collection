\begin{abstract}
Object detection and image classification models from Computer Vision are typically trained towards predicting labels of objects. 
Our goal is to extend such models to entry-level naming, where the task is to predict the natural name of an object that most humans would choose, instead of an \arbitrary name chosen by at best a few annotators. 
Based on large-scale, thoroughly verified object naming data from many annotators, we conduct an extensive analysis of the ability of object detection and classification models to account for entry-level object naming.
We show that standard object classification models ``spontaneously'' learn good entry-level names and perform better
on predicting entry-level than \arbitrary names, despite being trained on the latter, and that we can use transfer learning to train entry-level classifiers on the naming data. 
Our analyses also demonstrate the challenges of collecting data of language phenomena that is a proxy for real-world situations in which the phenomenon under occurs.  
%and systematically vary their training vocabulary. \cs{no diffs here with our setup of entry-levels only}

% Appendices should be \textbf{uploaded as supplementary material} when submitting the paper for review.

% \iffalse
% Supplementary material may report preprocessing decisions, model parameters, and other details necessary for the replication of the experiments reported in the paper.
% Seemingly small preprocessing decisions can sometimes make a large difference in performance, so it is crucial to record such decisions to precisely characterize state-of-the-art methods.
