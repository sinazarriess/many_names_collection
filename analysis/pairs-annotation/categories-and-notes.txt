t/f: same object true/false
1/2: w1 ... of w2 (.1) or viceversa, w2 ... of w1 (.2)

within f:

adjacent: w1 and w2 are adjacent (when no relationship can be assumed; e.g. I assume that for floor-carpet the floor supports the carpet, but for cat-pole I don't assume that the pole supports the carpet --> revert to conservative "adjacent").
supports/2.1: w1 supports w2  (or vic.)
part.1/2: w1 is part of w2 (or vic.)
other: none of the above (e.g. material; object vs. event as in plane-flight)

within t:

co-hyponyms: if they belong to the same category, up to the level of the domain. Includes near-synonyms (cat-kitten).
overlapping: the denotations of the names overlap, but they do not belong to the same category (cat-toy).
hypernym.1: w1 is hypernym of w2
hypernym.1: w2 is hypernym of w1

# in case we want to refine the spell-checking: "plain" for "plane" often

In ``other'': spelling mistakes, material ("wood", "wooden").
