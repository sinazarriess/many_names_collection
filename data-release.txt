created gbt Feb 21 2020

[the following was decided in a meeting by Carina and Gemma]

repo: https://github.com/amore-upf/manynames

- long-term: searchable interface (someone hired for it) @Gemma: see if we can hire someone from web design for this (probably need to do amendment to project), or itâ€™s assigned to the future PhD student

- for now: simply downloadable data + scripts + documentation. In two places:
  - github repo
  - UPF's e-repository @Gemma: find out how it works.
- deadline: March 27 (Friday of week before Easter).
  - reminder that LREC conference is May 13-15, and the data should be there by then (in case we don't make it by March 27, which we will :)

DATA to release:

- VG images (without bounding boxes) @Carina

- original (anonymized) crowdsourced data for ManyNames v.1 (LREC version, naming data)
[FUTURE? or already now? - original (anonymized) crowdsourced data for ManyNames v.2 (verification data)]

- aggregate version for ManyNames v.2
  - note that this INCLUDES verification data. Reason: otherwise people may give up using ManyNames if they only see v.1, because of the noise; and hopefully we'll get the verification data paper published soon (crossing fingers).
  - reminder to still call the dataset "ManyNames v.1" [which spelling? v1, v.1, v. 1?] in LREC final version, for clarity. In the documentation for the v.2 release, mention that v.1 is subsumed in the csv (simply deleting one/several columns).

SCRIPTS to release:

- original2aggregate-v1 @Carina chef, coordinates with @Sina
- v1_to_v2 @Matthijs chef, coordinates with @Carina
- data_loader4manynames @Carina chef and coordinates with herself 
- script that produces all our results from the LREC paper @Sina chef, coordinates with the rest

DOCUMENTATION to release:

Note for all of us: let's include only the information that is necessary to use the data/scripts and is not included in the paper (refer to the paper as often as we can for info when it is there, i.e. let's not duplicate info).

- @Gemma coordinates [and probably provides overall description in the main readme]

- documentation of scripts and how to use them: the chef of each of them

- data files: the chef of the corresponding script

- VG images: @Carina
  - Note from Gemma: VG is licensed under CC-BY, so we should provide the info required by the license, see here, section "Under the following terms": https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/

--- end of part agreed with Carina

REPO STRUCTURE proposed by G (@all, ok, or changes?)

- data folder, with
  - a readme
  - the csv files (see above)
  - a compressed file with the imgs

- scripts folder, with the scripts and a readme
