# ManyNames data collection

This repo contains a bunch of scripts for
* selecting images useful/interesting for object naming from VisualGenome
* setting up the AMT API
* scripts for assembling the ManyNames data from AMT results
* scripts on progress on verifying the collecting data
* and some papers, which where mostly rejected :-)
