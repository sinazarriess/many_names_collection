gbt, April 16

Instructions:

We asked Adam to draw a box around an object and name it. Then we asked other people to name the same object, but some made a mistake. From the following list, mark all the names that do not correspond to the same object as Adam's.

Remember: As long as the word refers to the same object, it is fine. For instance, for the following object, that Adam named "cake", it is fine to use "glove" [use the nice cake-in-the-shape-of-a-glove example]; however, "icing" is not good, because the icing is only a part of the cake.

Header:

Adam called this object ${nameA}. Other people called it:

[] dog
[] puppy
[] tail
[] ffff
