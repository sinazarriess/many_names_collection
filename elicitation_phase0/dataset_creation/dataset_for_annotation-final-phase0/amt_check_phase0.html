            <p>Sometimes there are different names for the same thing. Imagine the following situation:</p>
            <p>Person A annotates an image. She draws a bounding box around an object and labels it. Now, person B re-annotates the boxes drawn by A. B sometimes labels them with a different name. Why?<p>
